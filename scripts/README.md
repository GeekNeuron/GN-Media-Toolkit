## üìñ About This Project

The **GN Toolkit** is the result of an exploratory journey to challenge the maximum capabilities of command-line tools. What began as a simple need to merge files has evolved into a complete software suite with 16 distinct tools, capable of performing complex tasks including intelligent workflows, conditional processing, and full automation. This toolkit is designed for power users, media archivists, and anyone who seeks absolute control over their media files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Setup (Launch Checklist)

To get the toolkit operational, please follow these three steps carefully.

### Step 1: Get The Scripts
Place all 16 script files (`.bat`) from the `scripts` folder of this repository into a new, single folder on your computer. This will be your toolkit's main directory.

### Step 2: Install The Engines
This suite relies on 3 core application groups. Download them from the links below and place their executable files (`.exe`) in the **same folder** where you placed the scripts.

* **FFmpeg Suite (includes `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `ffplay`):**
    * **Download Link:** [**Gyan.dev FFmpeg Builds (Full Release Version)**](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z)
    * **Instructions:** After downloading, extract the `.7z` archive using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR. Copy the **three files** `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, and `ffplay.exe` from the `bin` folder and place them in your toolkit directory.

* **yt-dlp (for YouTube Downloading):**
    * **Download Link:** [**yt-dlp.exe (Latest Release)**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe)
    * **Instructions:** Simply place the downloaded `yt-dlp.exe` file directly into your toolkit directory.

* **ImageMagick (for Image Processing):**
    * **Download Link:** [**ImageMagick Official Download Page**](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
    * **Instructions:** Download and **install** one of the Windows versions.
    * **Crucial Installation Step:** During installation, make sure you check the box that says **"Add application directory to your system PATH"**. This is essential for certain tools to work correctly.

### Step 3: Final Systems Check
Your toolkit folder should now contain **16 script files** and **4 executable files** (`ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, `ffplay.exe`, `yt-dlp.exe`). ImageMagick should be installed on your system.

## üí° How to Use the Toolkit

The easiest way to start is by running the main launcher file: **`GN-Toolkit-v3-Final.bat`**.

This will present you with a central dashboard and a categorized menu, giving you access to all the other tools. Detailed instructions for each individual tool are provided below.

* **How to Use:**
    1.  Run the script from the main Toolkit launcher.
    2.  Drag and drop the video file you want to process into the window and press Enter.
    3.  The final `Scene Card.png` image will be saved in the same folder as your original video.
